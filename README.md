## About the Project

This project is an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of the Netflix catalog, focusing on the following aspects:
- The length of movies has been decreasing over the years
- Distribution of producing countries by decade
- Content trends added over the years

I used Python, pandas, and visualization libraries to identify insights that help understand Netflix's curation and strategy.

## Project Structure

The notebook contains the following analysis sections:

1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**: Loading the dataset and preprocessing the columns.
2. **Genres Duration Movies**: Visualizing Movies have longer average runtimes.
3. **Distribution by Countries**: Analyzing the producing countries of content across decades.
4. **Annual Content Distribution**: Analyzing trends in content added to the catalog over time.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`
 
## Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the results showed that while there are significant variations in the duration of movies across decades, it was not possible to identify a clear, consistent trend of decreasing duration over time. This study gave us a better understanding of how movies have changed over time, but it opens the door for further research, perhaps analyzing other aspects such as production budgets or shifts in audience preferences, consumption has changed and many streaming prioritize movies that can be consumed quickly.
